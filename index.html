      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My journey into technology began with an insatiable curiosity—one that turned into a relentless drive to build, innovate, and solve problems. Growing up, I was captivated by the idea of intelligent systems, inspired by movies like Iron Man and Ex Machina. The dream of creating something as intuitive as JARVIS led me to pursue a Master’s in Computer Science, where I now work on AI applications, data-driven solutions, and scalable software systems that push the boundaries of what’s possible.<br>

        For me, technology isn’t just about writing code—it’s about crafting solutions that make an impact. Whether it’s optimizing algorithms, designing user-friendly applications, or harnessing AI for real-world challenges, I thrive at the intersection of creativity and logic. Collaboration fuels my work, and I love exchanging ideas with like-minded thinkers who share a vision for innovation.
        
        <br>When I’m not immersed in tech, you’ll find me getting lost in a sci-fi novel, experimenting with new recipes, or taking long walks where my best ideas often take shape. For me, the best breakthroughs happen when you step away, breathe, and let inspiration strike.</p>
